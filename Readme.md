Once export data from QnA Maker when active learning turns on, you will find auto-generate suggestion data on the SuggestedQuestions column. PFA image and blue highlighted area, Unfortunately, I am not able to find the image with data on SuggestedQuestions column.

If you want to sync between this suggestion data on the train data which is being managed by manual or other tool and the suggestion data which is being created from QnA Maker. you can utilize this code.

The intent of questions will be extracted from the file name of excel.

e.g. Excel file name : itent1_qna.xlsx -> The QA in this file would be assigned as an intent1.

The matching algorithm for detecting the existence of duplicates question and answer is using a unique id which is generated by merging question and answer after clearing junk text.
